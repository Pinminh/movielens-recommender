# I.	Ideas
Recommendation algorithms are generally categorized into three main groups: **Content-based Filtering**, **Collaborative Filtering**, and **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithms**. Among these, **Collaborative Filtering** is considered the most important and is often divided into two types: **User-based Collaborative Filtering** and **Item-based Collaborative Filtering**.  
**Collaborative Filtering (CF)** aims to predict a user's preferences or behaviors based on information from other users. The algorithm works on the assumption that if two users tend to like the same items in the past, there is a high probability that they will have similar preferences in the future.  
For example, suppose we want to predict whether a user will like Celine Dion's new album based on the fact that he gave a 5/5 rating to a Beatles album.  
In **Item-based CF**, the algorithm predicts the rating of a product based on ratings for similar products. One of the common techniques used is **linear regression** (f(x) = ax + b). However, if there are 1,000 products, up to 1,000,000 linear regression functions need to be learned, requiring 2,000,000 regression coefficients. This is a significant weakness of this method, as building too many models can lead to the issue of **overfitting**.  
To address this drawback, in 2005, Daniel Lemire and Anna Maclachlan proposed a simpler algorithm called **Slope One**. This algorithm is based on the difference between user ratings for pairs of products. Specifically, if a user prefers product A over product B, the difference between the two ratings can be used to predict his preference for a new product. This means that the difference between the ratings of two products can be used to estimate the rating for a product that the user has not rated yet.  
The **Slope One** algorithm is the simplest form of **Item-based CF**. Its simplicity makes it easier and more efficient to implement, while its accuracy is often comparable to more complex and computationally intensive algorithms.  
# II.	Formulation 
Given a rating matrix *R* with dimensions *m × n*, where:  
•	*m* is the number of users.    
•	*n* is the number of products.  
•	Each element ***R<sub>ij</sub>*** in the matrix represents the rating given by user *i* for product *j*.  
•	If ***R<sub>ij</sub>*** = *∅*, it means that user *i* has not rated product *j*.  
**Objective:** Predict the ratings of users for the products they have not rated (the cells ***R<sub>ij</sub>*** that are empty in the matrix) based on the existing ratings.  
## 1. User Average Rating
![](../images/calculateAverage.png)  
Where:  
•![](../images/uu.png) : Represents the average rating given by user *u*.  
•***R<sub>u</sub>***: Is the set of items that user *u* has rated.  
•***R<sub>u</sub>***: The number of items rated by user *u*.  
•***r<sub>uj</sub>***: The rating given by user *u* for item *j*.  
## 2. Deviation Formula 
![](../images/itemDeviation.png)  
Where:  
•***dev(i,j)***: Represents the average deviation between the ratings of item *i* and item *j*.  
•***|U<sub>ij</sub>|***: The number of users who have rated both items *i* and *j*.  
•***U<sub>ij</sub>***: The set of users who have rated both items *i* and *j*.  
•***r<sub>ui</sub>***: The rating given by user *u* for item *i*.  
•***r<sub>uj</sub>***: The rating given by user *u* for item *j*.  
## 3. Prediction Formula
![](../images/predictedRating.png)  
Where:  
•![](../images/rui.png) : Is the predicted rating that user *u* would give for item *i*.  
•![](../images/uu.png) : Is the average rating that user *u* has given, which reflects the general tendency of this user to rate items (e.g., some users tend to give higher ratings than others).  
•***R<sub>i</sub>(u)***: Is the set of related items, i.e., the set of items *j* that user *u* has rated and that have at least one user in common with item *i*.  
•|***R<sub>i</sub>(u)***|: Is the number of related items in ***R<sub>i</sub>(u)***.  
•***dev(i,j)***: Is the average deviation between the ratings of item *i* and item *j*.  
# III. Algorithm
**Step 1: Initialize Data**  
	Collect data: Gather data from users and products to create a rating matrix. Each row in the matrix represents a user, and each column represents a product. The value in the matrix is the rating that the user has given to the product (or it could be a None/NaN value if the user has not rated the product).  
**Step 2: Calculate User Averages**  
	For each user *u*:   
	![](../images/calculateAverage.png)   
	Where ***R<sub>u</sub>*** is the set of items that user *u* has rated.  

**Step 3: Calculate Item Deviations**  
	Create a deviation matrix ***dev(i,j)*** for all pairs of items i and j:  
	For each pair of items i and j:  
  Find all users u who have rated both items i and j.  
  Calculate the deviation:

## Pseudocode
```Pseudocode
function slopeOnePredict(userId, itemId, ratings):
    // Step 1: Initialize data
    userAvgRating = {} // Dictionary to store average rating of each user  
    itemDeviation = {} // Dictionary to store deviations between items  
  
    // Step 2: Calculate user averages  
    for user in ratings:  
        userRatings = ratings[user] // Get ratings for the user  
        userAvgRating[user] = calculateAverage(userRatings)  
  
    // Step 3: Calculate item deviations  
    for itemA in ratings.items():  
        for itemB in ratings.items():  
            if itemA != itemB:  
                commonUsers = findCommonUsers(itemA, itemB, ratings)  
                if commonUsers:  
                    deviation = calculateDeviation(itemA, itemB, commonUsers, ratings)  
                    itemDeviation[(itemA, itemB)] = deviation  
  
    // Step 4: Predict the rating  
    relevantItems = findRelevantItems(userId, ratings)  
    predictedRating = userAvgRating[userId]  
      
    if relevantItems:  
        for item in relevantItems:  
            predictedRating += (1 / len(relevantItems)) * itemDeviation[(itemId, item)]  
      
    return predictedRating  

function calculateAverage(userRatings):  
    total = 0  
    count = 0  
    for rating in userRatings:  
        total += rating  
        count += 1  
    return total / count if count > 0 else 0  
  
function calculateDeviation(itemA, itemB, commonUsers, ratings):  
    totalDeviation = 0  
    for user in commonUsers:  
        totalDeviation += (ratings[user][itemA] - ratings[user][itemB])  
    return totalDeviation / len(commonUsers)  
  
function findCommonUsers(itemA, itemB, ratings):  
    commonUsers = []  
    for user in ratings:  
        if itemA in ratings[user] and itemB in ratings[user]:  
            commonUsers.append(user)  
    return commonUsers  
  
function findRelevantItems(userId, ratings):  
    // Return the list of items rated by the user  
    return ratings[userId].keys()

## IV.	Evaluation
**Advantages:**  
**Simple and Easy to Understand:** Slope One has a simple mathematical structure, making it easy to understand and implement. Calculating the average and deviation between items is not too complicated.  
**Efficient:** Slope One often produces accurate and efficient predictions, especially when there are many users who have rated similar items.  
**Scalability:** The algorithm scales well as the number of items and users increases. It remains effective even when there are many items and ratings.  
**Reduced Overfitting:** Compared to some other methods (such as complex linear regression), Slope One has a lower tendency to overfit due to its simplicity.  
**Low Memory Requirements:** Slope One requires less memory to store the necessary information for making predictions compared to some more complex algorithms.  

**Disadvantages:**  
**Dependent on Rating Data:** The algorithm may perform poorly if there is insufficient rating data or if the rating data is incomplete. If users only rate a small number of items, the prediction accuracy decreases.  
**Limited to Pairwise Product Relationships:** Slope One primarily relies on pairs of items to calculate deviations, which can limit its ability to predict when there are not many related items among users.  
**Does Not Handle Sparse Data Well:** When data is very sparse (many items but few user ratings), Slope One can struggle to find relationships between items and users.  
**Limited User Relationship Consideration:** Slope One focuses more on relationships between items rather than between users. If user relationships are more important, the algorithm may not perform well.  
**Limited Recommendation Capability:** Because predictions depend on similarities between existing items, Slope One may not be able to recommend new or unpopular items that have no user ratings.
